  <b> Higher accuracy PSX-like shaders for Godot Engine</b>
</p>

`GPSX` consists in a few shaders that allow you to achieve imagery akin to that of Sony's PS1.

Emulated are 15-bit color depth, dithering, fog, vertex precision, and all may be changed to your needs.

Additionally a sky shader is provided to give it the proper accurate look.

### Usage

Include the shaders within your project. Create `.tres` materials as needed to speed-up things.

*All* PS1 blend modes are replicated and may be used as desired.
